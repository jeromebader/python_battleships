# PyGame / Python Battleships

The very famous Battleship game with one human player
on one map with some ships and on the other map an AI player.

This game I have written in Python with PyGame Module,
Numpy arrays and also uses advanced Python concepts such as
OOP and recursive functions.


The project uses 4 files:
Main 
Clases
functions
Config

Assets such as images and sound effects are in the assets directory.
